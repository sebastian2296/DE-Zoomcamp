## Batch vs Streaming

Batch processing:

- Sequential processing of chunks of data grouped by a specific time frame (hourly, daily, weekly).

Streaming processing:

- Event driven processing; each time an event is triggered, the processor applies the transformation and saves the result in a database or DWH.


## Types of Batch jobs 

- Python scripts (can be run in kubernetes, AWS Batch)
- SQL transformations (dbt)
- Spark
- Flink


## Orchestrating batch jobs 

- Airflow: How would a typical workflow look like?:

    - Datalake -> Python Script -> SQL (dbt) -> Spark -> Python Script


## Advantages and disadvantages of batch jobs

#### Advantages:

- Easy to manage: allows us to parametrize each of the steps in our workflow.

- Easy to retry if something fails.

- Easier to scale: add more computing power when needed.

#### Disadvantages:

- Delay: We have to wait until the time interval completes for each of the steps in the workflow.
