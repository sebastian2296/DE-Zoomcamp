## Spark

Def: Data Processing Engine 

Spark pulls data from a database into his workers to complete some kind of transformation and then saves this result in another database or DWH.

- When to use Spark?

It's not always easy to use SQL to do data transformation. 

If it's easy to express the job in SQL, go for SQL. 

If you need more flexibility (unit tests, different functionality), use Spark (ML).
